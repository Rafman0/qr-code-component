## My process

- So i started by creating the variables, and then the background color(body). 
Then i started styling the container and everything came in nicely.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SASS
- google fonts (for the fonts).

### What I learned

i learnt how to do a little inline indentation.

```html
<h3>improve your front-end skills<h3>

```sass
.b-text
    text-indent: 7px

```

### Continued development

i'd like to focus more on css flexbox, and grid system. And also line indentation.

### Useful resources

-[chatGPT], helped me explain how i could use the "text-indent", by giving this example 
(
    p {
    text-indent: 1em;
}
)
